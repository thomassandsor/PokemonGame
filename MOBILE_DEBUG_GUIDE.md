This guide will help you debug mobile authentication issues using the comprehensive debugging tools added to the PokÃ©mon Game.

## Quick Access to Debug Tools

### Method 1: Floating Debug Button (Mobile Only)
- The debug button (ðŸ”§) appears automatically on mobile devices
- Located in bottom-right corner of the screen
- Tap to open the mobile debug panel

### Method 2: Admin Portal
1. Navigate to `/admin` after logging in
2. Click "ðŸ“± Show Mobile Debug" button
3. View comprehensive debug information

### Method 3: URL Parameter (Any Device)
- Add `?debug=mobile` to any URL to show the floating debug button
- Example: `https://your-app.com/login?debug=mobile`

## Debug Features Available

### Device Information
- Device type detection (iOS, Android, Desktop)
- Browser identification (Safari, Chrome, etc.)

- **Clear Auth Cache**: Remove all MSAL cache data
- **Refresh Logs**: Update debug log display
- **Clear Logs**: Reset debug log history

### Debug Logs
- Timestamped log entries
- MSAL event tracking
- Authentication flow details
- Error messages and stack traces
- Device-specific information

## Mobile Authentication Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Check Device Compatibility
1. Open debug panel
2. Verify device type is correctly detected
3. Check if private mode is detected
4. Ensure localStorage and sessionStorage are available

### Step 2: Clear Cache and Test
1. Use "Clear Auth Cache" button
2. Refresh the page
3. Attempt login again
4. Monitor debug logs for errors

### Step 3: Monitor Authentication Flow
1. Before login attempt, clear logs
2. Start login process
3. Watch real-time MSAL events in debug panel
4. Look for error patterns or timeouts

### Step 4: Check Environment Variables
1. Review Environment Information section
2. Verify API_BASE_URL is correct
3. Check CLIENT_ID and AUTHORITY values
4. Ensure REDIRECT_URI matches current domain

## Common Mobile Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Blank Screen After Login
**Symptoms**: Page goes blank after successful authentication
**Debug Steps**:
1. Check logs for navigation errors
2. Verify redirect URI matches current URL
3. Look for JavaScript errors in console
4. Check if accounts are being stored properly

### Issue: Login Loop
**Symptoms**: Repeatedly redirected to login page
**Debug Steps**:
1. Check if private mode is interfering
2. Verify cache location (should be localStorage on mobile)
3. Clear auth cache and test
4. Monitor MSAL events for token acquisition failures

### Issue: Authentication Timeout
**Symptoms**: Login process never completes
**Debug Steps**:
1. Check network connectivity
2. Verify timeout values (mobile uses longer timeouts)
3. Look for popup blocking issues
4. Monitor for iframe loading errors

## Critical Mobile Issue: White Screen After Authentication

### Issue: Stuck on White Screen After Login
**Symptoms**: 
- Login process starts successfully
- User completes authentication with Microsoft
- Browser shows white/blank screen instead of redirecting to app
- Page appears to be loading indefinitely
- Debug tools may still be accessible

**This is the most common mobile authentication issue - here's how to debug it:**

### Immediate Debug Steps:

#### Step 1: Check Debug Logs During Authentication
1. Open the floating debug button (ðŸ”§) before attempting login
2. Clear all logs using "Clear Logs" button
3. Start the login process
4. **DO NOT CLOSE** the debug panel during authentication
5. Monitor logs in real-time during the authentication flow
6. Look for specific error patterns:
   - Navigation errors after successful authentication
   - MSAL redirect handling failures
   - Token storage issues
   - JavaScript errors during redirect processing

#### Step 2: Check MSAL Authentication State
1. After getting stuck on white screen, open debug panel
2. Click "Log Auth State" button
3. Check if:
   - Accounts are being stored (should show > 0 accounts)
   - Active account is set
   - Tokens are present in cache
4. If accounts exist but page is still white, this indicates a navigation/redirect issue

#### Step 3: Monitor Browser Console
1. Open browser developer tools (if available on mobile)
2. Check Console tab for JavaScript errors
3. Look for errors related to:
   - Navigation failures
   - React routing issues
   - MSAL redirect promise handling
   - Cross-origin or CORS errors

#### Step 4: Test Manual Navigation
1. While stuck on white screen, manually navigate to `/my-page`
2. If this works, the issue is redirect handling after authentication
3. If this doesn't work, the issue is authentication state persistence

### Advanced Debugging for White Screen Issue:

#### Test Different Authentication Methods:
1. **Clear Cache Completely**:
   - Use "Clear Auth Cache" in debug panel
   - Clear browser cache manually
   - Close and reopen browser
   - Try authentication again

2. **Test Different Browser Modes**:
   - Regular browsing mode
   - Private/Incognito mode (note: may have different behavior)
   - Different mobile browsers (Safari, Chrome, Edge)

3. **Monitor Redirect Flow**:
   - Watch URL changes during authentication
   - Note if URL contains authentication parameters after login
   - Check if redirect URI matches current domain

#### Common Causes and Solutions:

**Cause 1: MSAL Redirect Promise Not Handled**
- **Symptoms**: Authentication succeeds but app doesn't navigate
- **Solution**: Check that `msalInstance.handleRedirectPromise()` is completing
- **Debug**: Look for "Redirect response received" in logs

**Cause 2: React Router Navigation Issues**
- **Symptoms**: Authentication succeeds but routing fails
- **Solution**: Check React Router configuration and protected routes
- **Debug**: Manually test navigation to protected routes

**Cause 3: Token Storage Issues on Mobile**
- **Symptoms**: Authentication appears to succeed but tokens aren't persisted
- **Solution**: Verify localStorage/sessionStorage availability
- **Debug**: Check storage availability in Device Information section

**Cause 4: Private Mode Interference**
- **Symptoms**: Works in normal mode but fails in private browsing
- **Solution**: Enhanced private mode handling may be needed
- **Debug**: Compare behavior between normal and private modes

**Cause 5: Network/Timing Issues**
- **Symptoms**: Intermittent failures, especially on slower connections
- **Solution**: May need longer timeouts or retry logic
- **Debug**: Check response times in API health section

#### Specific Mobile Browser Issues:

**Safari iOS**:
- May have stricter popup blocking
- LocalStorage behavior differs in private mode
- Cross-origin restrictions may apply

**Chrome Android**:
- Generally more permissive
- Better debugging tools available
- May handle redirects differently

**In-App Browsers** (Facebook, Instagram, etc.):
- Limited JavaScript capabilities
- May block certain authentication flows
- Often require fallback authentication methods

### Recovery Steps:

If stuck on white screen:
1. **Don't refresh immediately** - capture debug logs first
2. Use debug panel to export current state
3. Try manual navigation to `/login` or `/my-page`
4. If manual navigation works, clear auth cache and retry
5. If nothing works, clear all browser data and start fresh

## Support Information

If you encounter persistent issues:
1. Export debug logs using browser developer tools
2. Include device information from debug panel
3. Note specific error messages and timestamps
4. Include browser and OS versions

The debug tools provide comprehensive information to diagnose mobile authentication issues effectively.
